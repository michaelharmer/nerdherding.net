Johanna Rothman has an <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/archive/2004_06_01_mpdarchive.html#108610521300957283">interesting new post about rework </a>- her list of remedies is good and includes this little beauty: 
<blockquote>"See how little you can do, and deliver that much as quickly as possible."</blockquote>

For me, that quote almost entirely sums up agile approaches to software development.  Do a little, quickly.  See where its wrong, re-orient and start again.
