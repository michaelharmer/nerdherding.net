<a href="http://caustictech.typepad.com/caustictech/2004/06/i_know_everythi.html">This</a> is a very very funny post on a very funny blog.  I hope the level causticness can be maintained for the long-haul.  Found via the <a href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scobleizer</a>.

When managing, the best way I've found to deal with this sort of person is to give them lots of opportunities to present their ideas to the rest of the team.  Inevitably they'll bite off more than they can chew and will realise that they don't know absolutely everything.  An alternative conclusion is that they will paint themselves into a corner and I will be able to have a private chat to them about their lack of experience or judgement.

When I'm forced to work with this sort of dork I generally follow the same approach of letting them have as much rope as they need while all the while hinting to them that they might be heading down the wrong path.
