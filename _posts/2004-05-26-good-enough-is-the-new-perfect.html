<p>One of the hardest things for us nerds to stop doing is maxing out favourite aspects of our work.&nbsp; For example, I used to work for a team leader who would carefully calculate the run-time efficiency of every algorithm he wrote or he asked someone else to write.&nbsp; Endless discussions were held to decide if framework X's sort algorithm could be trusted to sort those ten entries into alphabetical order.&nbsp; Another person I worked with would tinker endlessly with control layout on dialog boxes and create complex formulae for others to use to ensure consistency of controls, labels, grouping boxes, tabs, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, while this was going on, the customer just wanted a simple dialog box that displayed the names of their contacts in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>I think what happended here is that the leaders of these projects (and almost every other project I've worked on)&nbsp;didn't create a shared view of perfection.&nbsp; They allowed the nerds, who all have their own peccadillos, to decide how much needed to be done.&nbsp; Instead they should have outlined their own view of perfection (using the idea of <a href="http://www.nerdherding.net/2004/05/20.html#a7">tradeoffs</a> I've talked about before) and made it clear that a "balanced good-enough is perfect".&nbsp; An ugly, misalinged dialog box isn't good enough and neither is a super-expensive beautifully laid out&nbsp;dialog.</p>
<p><strong>Good enough is the new perfect</strong>.&nbsp; This is one of the less explicit, but still important, messages that has come from agile software development.&nbsp; Maxing out a few aspects of our work&nbsp;is a way of selling our customers and projects short.&nbsp; We need to acknowledge that all aspects need to be collectively maximised and that this generally requires no aspect to be&nbsp;individually perfect.</p>
