Dare Obasanjo has a <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=fbe8824b-79e5-459d-98b0-b7153d0eda0e">new post </a>about something he calls <em>false goals</em>.  He describes them as software design goals that have become irrelevant and now are negatively impacting upon a project.  <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=fbe8824b-79e5-459d-98b0-b7153d0eda0e">Go read his post for more</a>.

I have seen the same thing happen, very frequently, in the user requirements sphere.  A marginally useful business feature is added to the list of requirements.  Happens all the time, especially when people are imagining the rosy new world that will spring into existence once a team of crack nerds comes to build a shiny new application for them.

Anyway, the feature, when implemented causes significant development and design drama due to its complexity.  More insidiously, in a fixed price scenario (government tender anyone?), the feature, since itisn't really needed doesn't get attention from customers for specification and turns into a project management nightmare.  "I'm afraid I can't sign off on the contract until all features are implemented.  Probity issues.  What if I get audited?  Anyway, are you trying to rip us off?"  Can you tell that I might have been here?  Once or twice?

That feels better now.
