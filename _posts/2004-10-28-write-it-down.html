I am often frustrated when discussing complex things or long lists of actions with some nerds.  Not because the nerds don't get it (at the time).  Not because I find it difficult to express things (well I do sometimes but let's ignore that for now).  Its because some people seem to think they they have such a large brain capacity that they don't need to write down any of the three or four dozen key pieces of information they receive over an hour long discussion.  

Things get forgotten if they aren't written down.  <strong>So for the sake of us all write it down!</strong>  Nobody is going to think that you are inferior if you need to take notes in order to remember a bunch of important stuff.  Oh, and for the love of all things good and beautiful at least <strong>pretend </strong>that your nerdherder might say something worth writing down and  <strong>bring a notepad and pen to any discussion</strong>.
