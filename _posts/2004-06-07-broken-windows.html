One of my favourite books is the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/shopsite_sc/shopping_cart/order.cgi?storeid=*146cef781a1f11071b3a3655&dbname=products&itemnum=6&function=add">Pragmatic Programmer </a>by <a href="http://www.toolshed.com/blog">Andrew Hunt </a>and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave">David Thomas</a>.  In it they espouse a "<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/extracts/no_broken_windows.html">broken windows</a>" theory to describe the rapid decline of software once it appears that nobody cares for reasonable standards.

This is a fantastic theory that has, in my experience, been proven correct time and time again.  Go buy their book right now and get a copy for every nerd you know.

P.S. I was reminded about this theory after talking to a friend and former co-worker.  It seems the theory applies to equally well to companies and management practices.

UPDATE (5 minutes after original post):  <a href="http://www.clarkeching.com/">Clarke Ching</a>, in his magnificence, already had a <a href="http://www.clarkeching.com/2004/04/broken_windows.html">post </a>on this exact subject.   He includes a link to the original article about broken windows.  I didn't copy.  Honest.  But I would have done a better job if I had!
