For the past few days my daughter has had one of those (many) unknown viral diseases that afflict toddlers.  This has caused a few sleepless nights in my house.  The funny thing is that I feel exactly like I'm in a deathmarch - I can't quite think straight, feel like everything is coated in glue, don't really believe that anything will make it better, all the while believing (paradoxically) that after this next sleep or next dose of paracetamol she will magically get better.  

At least this ordeal is with my family and not a bunch of cranky nerds.

P.S.  My daughter doesn't have a fever anymore, the rash appears to be diminishing and she is sleeping happily.  Yay!
