How's your bedside manner?  Do you think about how you interact with people with less experience or knowledge than you?  You should.  At a very specific task level nerds almost always know more than everyone about their work.  Consider the code feature or document you have just finished.  Unless you have paired with someone for the entire task you know the most.  In fact, almost everyone is trusting that you have done a good job and that you have done it the best way.  This includes most of your colleagues, your boss and especially your customers.  

At higher levels of abstraction or with larger tasks the effect is reduced but still there.  The chances are that your boss knows much less about your current project than you.  Ditto for the customer.

If you are more of a nerdherder than a nerd then your boss and customers are definely at your mercy with regard to information and trust.

When you deal with all of these people who know less than you and are relying on you how do you interact with them?  Do you think about the fears they have?  Do you respect the trust they are putting in you?  Do you take time to ensure they understand as much as they want to and are capable of?

Understanding the goals, fears and concerns of the people who rely on your expertise and judgement will help you do a better job.  It will also help you to advance your career - nobody likes working with someone who doesn't seem to care about others and no (sensible) manager would consider placing such a selfish person in a position of increased responsibility.
