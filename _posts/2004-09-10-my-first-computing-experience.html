The first time I used a computer was back in high school.  It was a <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=191">Commodore PET</a>. My friend Kendall and I used to type in simple programs that were kindly left in the "computer room".   

The only really interesting thing, which in restrospect helps me to understand the complete helplessness that some people feel when confronted with computers, was that we didn't know that the shift key could be held down for any length of time.  So whenever we wanted to type in a capital letter we would attempt to press the shift key at exactly the same time as the letter.  About one out of every four or five attempts would result in a capital letter.  This was a bit frustrating, but this is what computers were like and we liked computers so we just put up with it.

It was many months before someone noticed our novel technique and told us the secret.  More than twenty years have passed and the memory is still fresh.  I hope that some of the clumsy UI's I've contributed to over the years haven't created such angst.  If they have, sorry.  I do know what it feels like.
