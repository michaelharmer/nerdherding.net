There is a trap that everybody with an optimistic bone in their body sets and then falls into.  Its taken years for me to recognise that I am about to set the trap for myself and to stop.  

What is this trap?  Its the belief that a weekend will be enough time to complete almost any task.  After all a weekend is <strong>two whole days</strong>.

"Need a set of modules to load and convert the data from format X into our system?  Yeah, of course I can do it by Monday.  I've got nothing else on this weekend."  

"That bug, the one which causes the server to slow-down, well  I've added some logging info over the last few days so I should have no problem in getting the cause of the bug found, and probably fixed, by Monday."

The trouble is that come the end of the weekend, of course, these grand plans haven't been realised.  This is okay if nobody was relying on the task being finished by Monday.  

P.S. I still fall into a version this trap from time to time - "Need a prototype version to run on your mobile phone to show the potential investors on Tuesday night?  No problem." - except now I give myself <strong>four whole days</strong> to do anything.
