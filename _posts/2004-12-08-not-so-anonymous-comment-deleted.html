Dear Friendly Admirer,
If you want to abuse me on my own site then at least have the guts to use your real name.  

P.S.  And if you really want to remain anonymous then it'd be a good idea not to send it from your work - the IP address is a bit of a giveaway (IP: 192.55.98.2 , mail.seeingmachines.com).  Gee, I wonder which sad, failed manager I know now works at seeing machines?
