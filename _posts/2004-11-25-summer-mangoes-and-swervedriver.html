A wonderful summer's day here in Oz.  I had a mango for breakfast and listened to most of <a href="http://host50.hrwebservices.net/%7Ewebucci/livemp3/mezcal%20head/07%20-%20swervedriver%20-%20duress%20(st%20andrews%20aud%20sbd%20combo%20mix).mp3">Duress </a>by Swervedriver on my short commute to work.  A good start to any day.

P.S.  I know its really only Spring but late November anywhere but Tasmania in Australia is really summer.
