<p>If you find yourself standing mouth open, shocked, at the time/cost estimate given to you by your local nerd for something that you thought was simple then you are not alone.&nbsp; This, of course, leaves you feeling powerless and frustrated since you thought it would only be a day or so to export the wub into the thingy.&nbsp; After all, exporting the megaWub took only a few hours and was much bigger.</p>
<p>What can be done about this?<!--more-->&nbsp; If you are the estimate-asker then ask for a range of estimates:</></p>
<ul> quick one hour/day estimate to do something along "these lines" (be sure to explain what you are trying to achieve not just what you want done in technical terms);
<li>a one day/week estimate to achieve the same ends but in a more comprehensive form; and</li>
<li>a one week/fortnight estimate to get a Rolls-Royce version.</li></ul>
<p>Its important to listen very carefully to the caveats that the nerd is going to place on each of the options - they are important.&nbsp; The chances are that there is a quick option that is viable but it will have limitations and they might be bad enough that you will accept one of the longer estimates.</p>
<p>If you are a nerd who has been asked for something:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Don't just give a single short&nbsp;answer.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Dig a little bit into the business problem that needs to be solved and be pro-active in offering multiple options (using the hour/day/week/fortnight time estimates as guides).&nbsp; </li>
<li>Be careful to ensure that the limitations of your options are well communicated and always follow-up with an e-mail to ensure that your information is properly understood and recorded.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Ask for more time to come up with the estimates if you aren't confident and ask your co-nerds for help.</li></ul>
