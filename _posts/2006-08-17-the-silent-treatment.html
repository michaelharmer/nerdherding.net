So you find yourself in your boss's boss's office.  He's sitting there in his nice suit and cufflinks smiling nicely.  Its been about 5 seconds since you finished answering his question about that troublesome project you're managing and he hasn't said a word.  Not one.  Maybe you didn't answer the question?  Perhaps he's annoyed at you?  Maybe he didn't understand?  Perhaps you explained yourself so poorly that he's stunned?

Probably not.

He's probably just an arrogant jerk playing power games with you.  You see there's this technique that "important" people sometimes use on those who they are sure are in awe of their power and all round importance.  They stay deliberately quiet when you indicate using non-verbal or verbal queues that you've finished talking.  The hope is that since you are a normal person inbued with social graces that you'll pick up the slack and keep talking.  Then, as you grope around your little brain, you'll spill the beans on your secret plans or whatever. After all you'll be so flustered.

What should you do.  Don't panic and choose one of these two options:
<ol>
	<li>Talk about anything even obliquely related to the subject.  Go into enormous, banal detail.  If you're talking about a project schedule then list every task you can think of.  Don't forget to give a history of which people have had anything to do with each individual task.  Most importantly, try not to pause for too long for at least a few minutes.  The idea is to apply a bit of aversion therapy.  He goes silent.  You babble.</li>
	<li>The alternative is to sit there quietly as well.  After all he asked a question and you answered.  If Mr Bossman has more questions then he should be able to ask shouldn't he?  After a while if he doesn't get a flustered reaction from you he'll probably not try it any more.</li>
</ol>
Hopefully you'll never face the situation.  I've only had it tried on me a few times.  The first time I was flustered and madly groped around for a while trying to answer the question.  By the next time I'd worked it out by reflecting on how uncomfortable I was the first time.  I used the babbling technique which worked - no more attempts from that guy.  The last time, with a different person, I tried the going silent technique.  I also tried to smile knowingly at him.  He gave up on the discussion (probably because he thought I was a deranged axe murderer).

P.S. If you've ever used this technique on someone then please stop reading my blog.  We don't want your kind around here.
