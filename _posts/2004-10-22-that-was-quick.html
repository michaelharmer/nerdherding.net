Yesterday afternoon I ordered some books (including Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell on <a href="http://www.clarkeching.com/">Clarke's</a> recommendation - better be good!) and they were in my letterbox <strong>before </strong>I left for work today.  I ordered them through <a href="http://www.bookware.com.au/">Bookware </a>who I've used a few times now.  Each time the experience gets better - highly recommended for all you Aussie nerds out there.
