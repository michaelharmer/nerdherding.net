Esther Derby has <a href="http://www.estherderby.com/weblog/archive/2005_10_01_archive.html#112966340014295838">this neat post</a> entitled "People who lower productivity" that reminds me of such a person from my past.  He is a relatively famous programmer, is always nice and sociable, but has an ego problem that matches his extreme raw hacking brilliance.  Anyway, in the mid-nineties I drew the short straw and got the job of porting some C language Windows 3.1 gui code he had written to Windows 95.  It was a giant struggle due to the needless complexity and some odd little quirks.  The thing that was sticks in my mind as needlessly difficult was that instead of ORing together symbolic constants for window-styles from windows.h (WS_X | WS_Y) he opened up the header file added the relevant constants together (probably in his head) and then pasted the raw magic number into the C file.  Now, I didn't know if the constant values had changed between Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 so I had to spend an hour or so working out what style constants he originally meant and then getting them into the source file.   AAARRGHHHHGHHH!  

Unfortunately for the company he is back and from all accounts hasn't changed much.  Leopards.  Spots.

P.S.  This one's for you Sasha.
