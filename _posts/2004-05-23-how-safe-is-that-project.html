<p>When I have been in the position of monitoring a number of projects there is something called the (Harmer) Safety Index that I use to decide which projects are most dangerous (ie most likely to be challenged).</p>
<p>Its a pretty simple idea, give each of the following areas a ranking of low/med/high and then focus upon the projects that have the lowest overall&nbsp;ranking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience of the team</strong> - this is obvious,&nbsp;the more experienced the team in the problem domain and tools being used the safer the project.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriateness of methodology</strong> - if the methodology being used by the team doesn&apos;t fit the project then things are more likely to go off track.&nbsp; For example, if a two people for three week project is using a heavy-weight methodology with multiple sign-offs, etc. then they will be placing their project at risk.&nbsp; Similarly, if a two year fixed-price project with a customer who is afraid to make decisions uses XP then again project safety is compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Constraints of the tools</strong> - some tools allow almost anything to be build (think Java, C++, etc).&nbsp; Others allow only certain types of projects to be built (Excel, Cold Fusion, vertical application customisations, etc).&nbsp; If the tool being used restricts the types of applications that can be built (and&nbsp;the needs of the project are met by the tools) then safey of the project is increased.&nbsp; I'll repeat that - <em>the more constrained a tool the safer a project is</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Skill of the project manager</strong> - this is a vital&nbsp;measure.&nbsp; I believe that almost all project failures are caused by poor project management.&nbsp; This is through missing important warnings signs, being incapable of leading the project towards completion or being unable to gain the resources needed by the project.</li>
<li><strong>Discoverability of requirements</strong> - its okay for a projects requirements to be unknown at the start of a project.&nbsp; What is important is how easy it is for the requirements to be discovered.&nbsp; Compare a project where there is a customer who is easy to get along with and who has a list of things she wants fixed with a project with nine customers from three different companies who change their mind constantly.&nbsp; Obviously the project with requirements that are more easily discovered will be safer.</li></ul>
<p>I know these are simply potential risks and can fit into a risk management process.&nbsp; I don't know many risk management processes that actually work but if you have one that does, then check that these potential risks are considered.&nbsp; Regardless, these make great headings on a project brief/progress report or good discussion points for project managers to discuss with their own "bosses" or project sponsors.</p>
