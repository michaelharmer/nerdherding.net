<p>I was thinking about <a href="http://www.clarkeching.com/2004/03/paradox_people_.html">paradox: people value complex design, rather than simple designs</a> (from I Think Not, Baby Puppy) where the point that people often value complexity greater than simplicity is made.&nbsp; Then if <a href="http://www.focusedperformance.com/2004_05_01_blarch.html#108453263685905830">On leverage</a> (from Frank Patrick's Focused Performance Blog) is added to the mix we get a corollary to the paradox which, from my experience, rings true - people will value multiple incremental improvement efforts over a single swift and well focused improvement because the former looks more complex.</p>
