<p>Sorry to inject some Australian politics but <a href="http://backpagesblog.com/weblog/archives/000431.html">this post</a> will save me a bit of typing:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><em>This 30th anniversary stuff is a joke, an embarrassment and a shame to the history of this nation. </em></p>
<p><em>John Howard has diminished not only Australia&apos;s reputation as a regular, decent, world citizen, he has also dramatically reduced the range within which we as a nation can imagine ourselves.</em></p>
<p><em>Howard is the PM who has succeeded more than any other PM in making us all citizens living within a smaller, narrower, more limited nation.</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
