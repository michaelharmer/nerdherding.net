<a rel="external nofollow" href="http://ideoplex.com/">Dwight Shih</a> has tagged me with the surely dead (except for me) five things meme.

So in order to not be too curmudgeonly here I go:
<ol>
	<li>I've got two kids, a 5yo and a 13mo and a lovely & intelligent wife.</li>
	<li>I live in Canberra, Australia.</li>
	<li>I love cooking even more than I love nerdery and software development.  That's a lot.</li>
	<li>I've worked part-time for about five years now and I recommend it to anyone who can afford the cut in income.  Especially if you are a parent - there is nothing like having a spare/bonus/free day every week to spend with your kids.  That is until they start full-time school like one of my kids just has.</li>
	<li>My first job after I finished university was working for a startup working on an expert system shell in Prolog (and C).  Much fun and hilarity ensued.</li>
</ol>
I take it I'm supposed to pass the meme onto some others so here goes - <a href="http://thejjjj.blogspot.com">Justine</a> and <a href="http://www.financialcryptography.com/">Iang</a> your numbers are up.
