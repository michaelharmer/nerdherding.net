The most valuable business lesson that a toddler can teach her parents (apart from work part-time if you can) is to <em>start doing everything the way you intend to keep going</em>.  If the first time you go to a particular shop you cave in to a mini-tantrum or extravagant begging and buy her a present or a chocolate or an ice cream, etc.  Then whenever that same shop is approached a maxi-tantrum or super-extravagant begging will occur.  Similarly, if you let your daughter sit on the stool near the kitchen bench while you make dinner, then you had better be prepared for that to continue.  The pain of undoing a moment's weakness can be almost unbearable.

What's the business hook?  Glad you asked.  If you hire someone then be very careful to have them do things the way you want them to continue to do them.  Don't be lazy or try to avoid conflict and decide to fix the problem "...in a few weeks, the next time he nukes someone else's code during a check-in".  Two things will happen.   The new hire will decide that you don't care about quality (if he/she is aware of the mistake/sloppiness) or the new hire will feel unfairly stupid when (if?) you eventually provide feedback.  The other problem is that all other staff will be paying attention to the new hire (as they always do) and will probably notice that you apparently no longer care about quality.

The same goes if you get a promotion, or a transfer or a new job where you are a (petit-)boss.  In this case it is <strong>absolutely vital </strong>that you start true and stay true.  There are lots of people watching and they are looking for little signs so they can discover what you <em>really </em>care about not just what you <em>say </em>you care about.
