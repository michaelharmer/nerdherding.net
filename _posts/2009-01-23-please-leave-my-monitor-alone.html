<h2>The problem</h2>
I love the 24inch monitor I have at work and my co-workers know it.  I'm on leave right now and they sent me this picture of my baby being abused.  <a href='/images/2009/01/image089.jpg'><img src="/images/2009/01/image089-300x225.jpg" alt="Michael J licking my monitor" title="mj_licking_my_monitor" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120" /></a>

<h2>The solution</h2>
I created a little site called <a href="http://ifyoutouchmymonitoryouwilldie.info/">if you touch my monitor you will die</a> and sent the culprits a link to it. 

If you suffer from the same problem feel free to make use of <a href="http://ifyoutouchmymonitoryouwilldie.info/">ifyoutouchmymonitoryouwilldie.info</a> to create a little bit of a disincentive.  

<h2>The result</h2>
It didn't really work - the next day I got this sent to me: <a href='/images/2009/01/image091.jpg'><img src="/images/2009/01/image091-300x225.jpg" alt="Lots of hands touching my monitor" title="lots_of_hands_touching_my_monitor.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-121" /></a>

Oh well.
