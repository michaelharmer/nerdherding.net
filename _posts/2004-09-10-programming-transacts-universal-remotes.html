This one is for those here in Canberra who have a TransACT set-top box and would like to program their universal remote to control their TV, VCR, DVD, etc.

There is an almost mythical instruction manual (I have seen one) that describes how to do it and includes the magic numbers that tell the remote what make of TV, VCR, etc you have.  If you are luckly you will know someone who subscribed really early and will have a copy of the manual.  TransACT apparently stopped handing them out because they were too hard for some (apparently rather dumb) people to figure out and so caused lots of support calls.

If you don't know anyone with a copy of the manual there is a <a href="http://www.urcsupport.com/html.php?page_id=75">website </a>for the manufacturer of the remote that describes who to program them and what the codes are.  I'm sure you are smart enough to work it out (if not phone TransACT not me).

(Thanks to Michael J and Richard the hippy for lending me the manual and to my parents for teaching me to read so I could notice the URL on the back of the manual.)
