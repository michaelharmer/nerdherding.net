Seth Godin wrote a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/06/the_seduction_o.html">post</a> in which he is critical of creating things that are <em>good enough</em>.  He is saying that <em>good enough</em> is the opposite of <em>the pursuit of better</em> (or as he calls it the relentless pursuit of better).  

This is, to borrow a phrase, crazy talk.  <em>Good enough</em> is an important stopping point on the way to <em>better</em>.  If you don't stop at <em>good enough</em> then you won't ever reach <em>better</em>.    I think that Seth's own example of JetBlue turning one third of the toilets on its planes into a ladies only toilet demonstrates this.  Did JetBlue delay launching their airline until this epiphany came to them?  Clearly they didn't.  They created a package that was <em>better </em>than their competitors which had <em>good enough</em> aspects and great aspects.  Coming back to make the <em>good enough</em> bits <em>better </em>is fine but they went with <em>good enough</em> knowing that waiting for <em>better </em>on everything would kill them.

Perhaps a better idea (sorry) is to make sure that at least some aspects of our products/services are <em>better </em>and that the rest are <em>good enough</em> and then made <em>better </em>as soon as is sensible.  I wonder if Seth would agree?
