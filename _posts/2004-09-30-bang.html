One of the funny things that Australian (and maybe British??) nerds eventually discover when they talk to their American counterparts is that an exclamation mark (!) is pronounced "bang".  How wierd.  Quicker to say and definately more fun but somewhat, I dont know, incongruous.  Nobody expects to play a game of cowboys and indians in the middle of a conversation about boolean disciminators.  Anyway, if this takes off in Oz it would just about make up for having to call subroutines and functions spelt incorrectly (e.g. getColor instead of getColour).  

I shouldn't complain at least (Antipodean) English is my first language.  I must be hard for non-English speaking nerds to have to deal with English-named libraries.  Does anyone know if there are localised versions of libraries?  Something like de.java.lang?  Maybe we could have au.en.java.awt.Colour to fix our delicate spelling prejudices.

[I was reminded of the whole bang thing by <a href="http://www.megnut.com/2004/09/two-geek-in-the-kitchen-stories">this post</a> from Meg Hourihan.]
