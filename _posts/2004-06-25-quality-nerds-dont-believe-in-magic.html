I believe that the best way to distinguish between an average nerd and a nerd with inherent potential is to see how they react to magic in a project.

What do I mean by magic?  Magic has happended when:
<ul>
	<li>a problem is solved by a seemingly unrelated action (e.g. changing the order of unrelated actions stops a system failure).</li>

	<li>a chunk of code is copied en masse into a new project and nobody understands how (or even why) it works. </li>
 
	<li>a recurring but seemingly random crash disappears.</li>
</ul>

When magic happens the more average nerd simply shrugs, maybe thanks the coding gods, and then simply moves onto the next piece of work.  A quality nerd will get nervous.  She will try work out why the magic worked.  Many theories will be tried out.  Experiments will be run.  Co-workers will be consulted.  In short, the better the nerd, the more effort expended on rational investigation rather than simply accepting good luck.

As I said earlier, I have found the reaction to magic in software to be a fantastic indicator of nerdly quality and leadership potential.  What about you?  Do you believe in magic?  Do you think its a good indicator of nerdly quality?
