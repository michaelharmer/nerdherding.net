Sometimes people are ready to go and solve big nasty problems or lead a team for the first time or design a custom memory manager for that C++ server application.  Sometimes not.  The trick for managers is to be reasonably sure that your chosen one will succeed.  If you aren't sure then put in a safety net or someone is likely to get hurt.  Consider providing a mentor/coach for the task.  Another idea is to meet regularly to track progress and to arrest the slide into failure or to mitigate the consequences.  

Managers have a duty to ensure that their staff are not placed in a position where they are likely to fail or where failure will cause them to suffer.  To do so unfairly risks reputations, happiness and health.  I've seen too many decent, hard-working people damaged by careless and selfish task assignments.  This is not to say that people should be mollycoddled.  There is a middle ground.

Do <strong><em>you</em> </strong>send people out to fight dragons before they are ready?
