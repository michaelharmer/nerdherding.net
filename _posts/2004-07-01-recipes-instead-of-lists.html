If you are responsible for creating a list of tasks that need to be done to achieve something (anything) then think about providing an ordered list of actions (a recipe) instead of just a list of things that need to be done.  Seems like a very fine distinction?  It is.  A recipe will include infrastructure work and "planned re-work" that might otherwise be forgotten the alternative is simply a list of ingredients.  

Think of it as the difference between a list of parts that make up a car versus instructions for bolting a car together.  Without the instructions its tempting to believe that putting it together is simple.  With the instructions, its clear that its simple(ish), but will take some time.
