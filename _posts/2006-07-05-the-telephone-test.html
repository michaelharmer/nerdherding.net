I have a simple test that tells you a lot about the culture of any organisation.  There are two questions you need answer:
<ol>
	<li>If you are talking one on one in their office do managers generally answer the phone when it rings (thereby interrupting your conversation) or do they leave it for voicemail?</li>
	<li>Do managers regularly choose to delay or stand-up multiple subordinates when summoned by their superordinates?</li>
</ol>
If your answers are <em>interrrupt</em> and <em>stand-up</em> then you have a management culture that believes that they are central to getting things done.  This is, of course, pretty bogus, selfish and arrogant.  If you have only one of <em>interrrupt</em> and <em>stand-up</em> then you have a warning sign.  Hopefully, things are trending away from the arrogant management culture.  Managers exist to enhance the performance of others - if they do their job then they become less necessary.
