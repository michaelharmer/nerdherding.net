On the weekend my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Things-Every-Software-Architect-Should/dp/059652269X">97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know</a> arrived.  "So what" you say.  Well, a short <a href="http://97-things.near-time.net/wiki/prefer-principles-axioms-and-analogies-to-opinion-and-taste">article</a> I wrote was selected for inclusion in the book.  This is exciting given the quality of the other contributions.  My previous book writing experience was limited to the "Statute Expert Programmers Guide" and a few chapters of another Statute Expert manual/guide - given the niche nature of SoftLaw's technology neither book was a big seller or even readily available.  Having something available on Amazon with good reviews is nice. 
 
As the title subtly hints, the book contains ninety seven short essays/articles/axioms/comments/principles relating to the practice of software architecture.  The short bite format allows the content to be digested in small chunks and makes browsing a rewarding experience.  I've learned from the book and if you have anything to do with creating software then I expect you will too.
