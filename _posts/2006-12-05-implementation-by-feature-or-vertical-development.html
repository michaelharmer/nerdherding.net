I've just started leading an internal workshop on Incremental Development.  In the workshop I describe and delve into the difference between orienting development vertically (by use case) versus horizontally (by software layer or service).  By use case is the clear winner since it allows progress to be tracked in a user meaningful manner and encourages a smooth flow of client value.

Johanna Rothman <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/2006/12/measuring-project-completion-progress.html">describes the different orientations</a> as <strong>implementation by feature</strong> and <strong>implementation by architecture</strong>.  These are clearer phrases.

I think I'll be making a few minor edits tomorrow.
