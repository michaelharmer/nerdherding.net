Consider a useful process.  Why is the process useful?  Probably because it helps to avoid some sort of cost or (better) to provide some benefit.  In some cases a process, like making sure your parachute is properly strapped on, will help to avoid a disaster.  To illustrate how a disaster can be avoided using process I experimented on myself.  

Here's how I did it:
<ol>
	<li>Yesterday I flagrantly ignored the kitchen paper replacement process that has been working at my house for years - "when the last sheet of paper is finished on the roll get a new roll out of the cupboard and put it in a convenient place in the kitchen".</li>
	<li>This morning I paced around the house, in bare feet, talking to my friend Chris VL on the phone discussing the need for a coffee at the God's Cafe this morning.</li>
	<li>I didn't look where I was walking (due to animated conversation about the benefits of coffee) and I trod in <strong>cat vomit</strong> in the middle of the floor!  <strong>Gross!</strong>
</li>
	<li>After the initial revulsive concussions racking my body subsided I thought that it would be okay, I can just hop to the kitchen (a metre away) and wipe my foot with kitchen paper.  No worries.</li>
	<li>I hopped to the kitchen, opened the draw where the paper is kept and, as you have already guessed, it wasn't there.  At this point I recalled my flagrant process violation and panicked.  </li>
	<li><strong>Military Grade Disaster!!!!!!</strong></li>


</ol>

As you can see process can avoid disaster.  Believe me.
