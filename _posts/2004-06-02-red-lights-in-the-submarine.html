If you make a change to a project then consider making an accompanying physical change that will help underline the reality of the change.

<ul>	<li><em>Added a new member to your team?</em>  Move them into the same location as everyone else.  </li>
	<li><em>Promoted someone?</em>  Move them somewhere slightly different.  </li>
	<li><em>Gone into release mode?</em>  Shift the staff who will be most busy into a "situation room".  </li>
	<li><em>Changed process?</em>  Restructure your forms/reports/templates (if you have them) or meeting agendas.</li>

</ul>

Find any change that will help even the most non-communicative and insular nerd notice that something is different.
