<p>Berin Loritsch has a <a href="http://jroller.com/page/bloritsch/20040524#my_language_is_more_efficient">post</a> discussing various aspects of efficiency of programming languages.&nbsp; He concludes with:</p>
<blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<p><em>What I find most important is effeciency of maintenance. That means that the system should be self-explanatory, and provide enough information to be easily debugged. While creating a system as efficiently as possible is a concern, it is the poor maintenance guy that has to bear the brunt of the work. The easier it is for someone new on a team to get up to speed, the better the system is defined. Reducing the amount of code needed to describe a problem, and making it easy to understand what code performs which function are two very important ideals to pursue.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is good advice that I think also applies to decisions about frameworks and application architectures.&nbsp; I'm taking a bit of a&nbsp;gamble, having never communicated with him (except in reading his blog),&nbsp;but I think that using the list of attributes from my previous post (<a href="http://www.nerdherding.net/2004/05/20.html#a7">Talk about the tradeoffs</a>), he would place <strong>approachability</strong> and <strong>maintainability</strong> at the top of his priority list for teams in addition to when selecting programming languages.</p>
